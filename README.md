## Abstract Factory Method Design Pattern
## Definition of Abstract Factory Method
The **Abstract Factory** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Unlike the Factory Method, which creates one type of product, the Abstract Factory focuses on creating families of objects that are related, ensuring consistency across products and their representations.

This pattern is ideal when a system needs to support multiple product types (e.g., downloadable, service, and physical products) with specific presentations, while keeping the creation logic centralized and abstracted.
## About This Project

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the Abstract Factory Design Pattern in Laravel for a shop that manages multiple types of products. Each product type—such as **downloadable, service, or physical** —has its own specific properties and unique presentation format.

## How It Works in This Project

- **Product:**
  In this project, each product type (e.g., DownloadableProduct, ServiceProduct, and PhysicalProduct) implements the Product interface, which defines the common properties of a product such as title and price.
- **Presenter:**
  he presenter is responsible for defining the way the product is displayed.
  Each product type has its own presenter (e.g., DownloadablePresenter, ServicePresenter, PhysicalPresenter) that implements the Presenter interface, which includes the presente() method for product presentation.
- **Factory (Abstract Factory):**
  The ProductFactory interface serves as the abstract factory that defines the methods for creating both the product and its presenter.
  This ensures that each product and its presenter are created together and remain consistent.
- **Concrete Factories:**
  Concrete factories (e.g., DownloadableProductFactory, ServiceProductFactory, PhysicalProductFactory) implement the ProductFactory interface and provide the creation logic for specific product types and their corresponding presenters.
- **Client:**
  The client code interacts with the abstract factory (e.g., ProductFactory) and does not need to know the specific implementation being used.
  This promotes loose coupling, scalability, and flexibility when adding new product types.
